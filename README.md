dnCita (do not click in this area) prevents clicks in one or multiple areas of your choice.

Verifies the coordinates of the click, whether they are in a predetermined non-clickable area to perform this or not.

Designed for Diablo 3 without thinking of the hardcore community. ;-)

I hope it will save some hc characters in future.
